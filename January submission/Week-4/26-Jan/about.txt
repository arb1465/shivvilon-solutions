Hey! I'm Aasutosh Baraiya, a passionate programmer and final year Computer Science student at SVNIT Surat.
I began my coding journey driven by a love for mathematics and problem solving, which naturally led me into the world of Programming.
I enjoy building projects that blend logic with design, from C++-powered algorithms to responsive web apps using differenet technologies. I was part of a team of four that built 'KOE - The Kafe' for a college-wide hackathon.
Beyond coding, I care deeply about collaboration and mentorship, often supporting my peers in tech clubs and team projects.
I'm also drawn to clean design and intuitive user experience, believing that thoughtful interfaces can amplify impact.
With curiosity as my compass, I'm always learning.
