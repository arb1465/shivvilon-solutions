        <!-- Description -->
        <p class="text-gray-400 text-lg leading-relaxed">
            A passionate programmer and final year Computer Science student at SVNIT Surat.
            I began my coding journey driven by a love for mathematics and problem solving,
            which naturally led me into the world of Programming.
        </p>

        <p class="text-gray-400 text-lg leading-relaxed">
            I enjoy building projects that blend logic with design, from C++-powered algorithms
            to responsive web applications. I was part of a team of four that built 
            <span class="text-purple-400 font-semibold">'KOE - The Kafe'</span> for a college-wide hackathon.
        </p>

        <p class="text-gray-400 text-lg leading-relaxed">
            Beyond coding, I deeply value collaboration and mentorship, supporting peers in tech clubs
            and team projects. I'm drawn toward clean design and intuitive user experience,
            believing thoughtful interfaces amplify impact.
        </p>

        <p class="text-gray-400 text-lg leading-relaxed italic">
            With curiosity as my compass, I'm always learning.
